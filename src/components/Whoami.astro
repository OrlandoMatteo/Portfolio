    <h2 class="">What I studied</h2>

        <p class="">
            I received B.Sc Degree in Physics Engineering in 2015 and a M.Sc.
            degree in ICT for Smart Societies in 2018 with a thesis focused on
            designing and development of a self-configuring IoT smart-meter for
            monitoring the power grids and enabling novel services. Since
            October 2018, I joined the EDA group as a research assistant. I
            started my PhD in November 2019 focusing my research in the
            optimization of the placement of PV modules in the context of
            Renewable Energy Community.
