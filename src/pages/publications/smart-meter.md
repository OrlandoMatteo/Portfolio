In this paper, we present a novel distributed software infrastructure to foster
new services in smart grids with particular emphasis on supporting self-healing
distribution systems. This infrastructure exploits the rising
Internet-of-Things paradigms to build and manage an interoperable peer-to-peer
network of our prototype smart meters, also presented in this paper. The
proposed three-phase smart meter, called 3-SMA, is a low cost and open-source
Internet-connected device that provides features for self-configuration. In
addition, it selectively run on-board-algorithms for smart grid management
depending on its deployment on the distribution network. Finally, we present
the experimental results of Hardware-In-the-Loop simulations we performed.
