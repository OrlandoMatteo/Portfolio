Electric infrastructures have been pushed forward to handle tasks they were not
originally designed to perform. To improve reliability and efficiency,
state-of-the-art power grids include improved security, reduced peak loads,
increased integration of renewable sources, and lower operational costs. In
this framework“, smart grids” are built around bidirectional communication
technologies, where “smart meters” communicate with all other entities and
collect data from the power grid, offering specific features to each actor
playing in the energy marketplace. In this paper, to overcome some of the
challenges raised by smart grids and smart meters, we propose a distributed
metering infrastructure which provides bidirectional communication,
self-configuration, and auto-update capabilities. Our 3-phase smart meters
follow the basics Internet-of-Things principles and have the ability to run,
either on-board or distributed on the network, multiple algorithms for smart
grid management. These algorithms can be freely added, updated, or removed
on-the-fly thanks to the auto-update feature of the system. Moreover, to reduce
costs and improve scalability, we prove that it is possible to implement our
smart meters using only off-the-shelf and inexpensive hardware devices. A
digital real-time simulator (i.e., Opal-RT) has been used to assess the
capabilities of both the infrastructure and the meter. Our experimental
analysis shows that the latency introduced by the data transmission over the
Internet is compliant with the limits imposed by the IEC 61850 standard. As a
consequence, our architecture does not affect the operational status of the
smart grid, making it a viable solution to support the deployment of novel
services.
