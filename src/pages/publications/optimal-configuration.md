Following the Smart Grid view, current energy generation systems based on
fossil fuels will be replaced with renewable energy sources. Photovoltaic (PV)
is currently considered the most promising technology, due to decreasing costs
of the devices and to the limited invasiveness in existing infrastructures,
that make PV installations quite common urban buildings' roofs. To maximise
both power production and Return Of Investment (ROI) of PV installations, new
techniques and methodologies should be applied to limit sources of
inefficiencies, like shading and power losses due to an incorrect installation.
In this paper, we propose a novel solution for an optimal configuration and
placement of PV systems in buildings' roofs. Given a number of alternative
configurations and a roof of interest, it combines detailed geographic and
irradiance information to determine the optimal PV installation, by maximizing
both power production and ROI. Our simulation results on two real-world roofs
demonstrate an improvement on power generation up to 23% w.r.t. standard
compact installations. These results also highlight that a cost analysis, often
ignored by standard installation strategies, is nonetheless necessary to
guarantee optimal results in terms of PV production and revenue.
