This paper presents a digital resources ecosystem prototype of integrated tools
and resources to support heritage-led regeneration of rural regions, thanks to
a deeper understanding of the complexity of cultural natural landscapes
throughout their historical and current development. The ecosystem is conceived
as a distributed software platform establishing data ecosystem and open
standards for the management of information, aimed at providing different
services and applications to address the needs of the various end-users
identified. The platform has been conceived and realised in the framework of a
Horizon 2020 research project, with a view to building a set of holistic
knowledge about rural regions and their cultural and natural heritage and
making it available for long-lasting heritage-led territorial processes of
change. It is the product of a multidisciplinary collaboration among heritage,
digital humanities and ICTs experts, and combines data and methodologies from a
range of approaches to humanities together with the customisation of effective
digital tools. It has been designed for deployment also in cloud systems
compliant with the Infrastructure-as-a-Service paradigm. All data is Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR data). It hosts and integrates
different tools, making the data gathered with/for local stakeholders usable
and making the same data re-usable within the toolsâ€™ functions, generating
integrated heritage knowledge. It comprises data on 19 rural pilot territories,
where the tools and their integration have been developed and tested, while 62
more are partially included as additional territories which participate in
certain activities within the project. The main testers for this platform and
its functions are the local stakeholders of these territories. The paper
describes and analyses the platform and its impact, discussing the integration
of tools as an innovative approach that goes beyond the use of individual tools
in shaping a multidimensional vision. It also offers an analysis of the
potential of an integrated digital ecosystem in evidence-based and place-based
regeneration strategies. Some reflections for developments and cooperation
during the pandemic are also presented.
